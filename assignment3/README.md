# Assignment 3: Epsilon Photography

## Synopsis

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the concept of *Epsilon Photography*, which is where a scene is recorded via multiple images, each captured by an epsilon variation of the camera parameters. Perhaps the most cited paper on the subject is "Computational Photography: Epsilon to Coded Photography" by Ramesh Raskar in 2009, and it is included in the reading list for this class. You can read a copy of that paper at
