# Assignment 11: Video Textures

## Synopsis

In this assignment we will be applying our computational photography magic to video, with the purpose of creating video textures, or infinitely looping pieces of video. These are basically gifs with very smooth transtitions, as seen in Udacity CP Lecture 06-02, Video Textures.  The process is also described in [Video Textures](http://cs.colby.edu/courses/F07/cs397/papers/schodl-videoTextures-sig00.pdf) (Scholdl, et al; SIGGRAPH 2000).
