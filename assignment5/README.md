# Assignment #5, Camera Obscura

## Synopsis

In this assignment, you will construct a Camera Obscura (also known as a pin-hole camera), and document the construction and usage of the camera.  Modern cameras, including high-end DSLRs, are simply advanced versions of a camera obscura.  There is no coding for this assignment, and so the submission will consist purely of submitting the PDF file with your write-up.
