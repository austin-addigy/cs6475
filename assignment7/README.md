# Assignment 7: Feature Matching

In this homework assignment, we put into practice the code we have seen in lecture for feature detection and matching. This assignment has two parts. The first part of the assignment requires capturing five different images, and the second part requires performing feature detection and matching between a template and the remaining four images from part 1.
